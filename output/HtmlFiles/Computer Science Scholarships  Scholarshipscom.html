    <p>To be a professional computer genius, you will need training and have at least some amount of formal education. Those who plan to embark on a career in technology should seriously consider a degree in computer science. While a college dropout succeeded in founding Microsoft in 1975, that doesn't necessarily mean that a college dropout will succeed in getting a job coding for Microsoft today. A college education, and likely some additional certification, is necessary to succeed in the computer industry today.</p>
    <p>Of course the need to go to school brings about the problem of finding a way to pay for school. And in order to <a href="/financial-aid/financial-aid-information/pay-for-school/">pay for school</a>, chances are, you will need to <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/finding-scholarships-how-and-where-to-look/">find scholarships</a> or other <a href="/financial-aid/" title="Financial Aid" target="_top">financial aid</a>. Luckily, computer science majors are highly desirable, and as a result, have many <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-opportunities/">scholarship opportunities</a> available to them. To encourage the popularity and growth of the field, numerous scholarship providers have created computer science scholarships for students with an interest in technology. Major companies like <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/corporate-scholarships/google-scholarships/" title="Google Scholarships" target="_top">Google</a>, Microsoft, and Intel offer scholarships for the technology-minded student. Many smaller providers and <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/university-scholarships/" title="University Scholarships" target="_top">individual colleges</a> have also created funds that award computer science scholarships to students working towards a postsecondary degree.</p>
    <p>In addition to <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-major/" title="Scholarships by Major" target="_top">major-specific scholarships</a>, the savvy computer student might also want to <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/search-for-available-scholarships/">search for available scholarships</a> based on his or her other diverse skills, interests, and experiences. Internet debates can be great practice for <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/essay-scholarships/">essay scholarships</a> and early adopters of webcam technology might have an advantage in <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/video-contest-scholarships/" title="Video Contest Scholarships" target="_top">video-based and video gaming scholarship contests</a>. Our lists of wacky and <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/unusual-scholarships/">unusual college scholarships</a> might also be a good place to start, especially if your interest in geek culture extends beyond programming jokes.</p>
    <p>Below are just a few examples of computer science scholarships. To find more computer science scholarships, students can conduct a free college <a href="/scholarship-search">scholarship search</a> at Scholarships.com. At Scholarships.com, students will have access to information about more than 2.7 million <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/college-scholarships-and-grants/">scholarships and grants</a>. By using their major as a search criterion, students can find awards created to help those interested in computer science and computer engineering obtain a postsecondary education.</p><!-- Removed but keeping as a placholder. -->
